# Task search/list tools include tasks in multiple lists by default (include_timl) and expose task creation timestamps.
# Tag filters for search use ClickUp tag names and forward them as tags[] parameters.
# Subtask-aware tools surface hasSubtasks/subtaskCount/isSubtask flags; check them before assuming hierarchy.
